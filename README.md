# MoagCoin Miner
## WARNING!
This is a dumb meme project I made in a rush as part of a joke with friends. It is not meant to be used seriously or taken seriously. I lost some stuff when my gcloud expired so the flask server uploaded here may or may not be completely borked.

The difficulty of mining has been reduced and I have included my original wallet so debugging and poking around is easier.
## What is this?
This is the open source repository for the MoagCoin cryptocurrency.
The source code is distributed as-is, any faults or problems occured through use of this uncompiled version of the miner is your own problem
PyInstaller is recommended for compilation

`pyinstaller -i <icon>.ico --onefile miner.py`
